# Covid-19
My team and I (The Natives) created this data visualization to help monitor and inform the citizens of Nigeria about the spread of the Corona virus and also give them accurate information directly from the administrative bodies in charge.
Users can also take a quick self test to help monitor their health status.
The tools we used involved: QGIS for working with the geojson file, mapbox.js,HTML,javascript,CSS for building the platform.
